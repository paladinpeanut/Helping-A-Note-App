Helping-A-Note-App
This is a Medical Note App someone made that isn't accessible for screen readers. I'd like to figure out what can make it that way.
Hi, I liked this project another guy made because it's device agnostic but supposedly still works well. I noticed it uses Divs which often aren't used in an accessible way for screen readers to interact with.
I've tried it on both Windows and iPhone and it works with neither of the most popular screen readers (JAWS and Voiceover)
